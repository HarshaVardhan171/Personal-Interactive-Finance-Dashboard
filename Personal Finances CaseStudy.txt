Personal Finance Dashboard in Excel


Objective:
To design a dynamic, interactive, and visually compelling personal finance dashboard using Microsoft Excel 2016 
that tracks income, expenses, and savings trends over time to empower better financial decision-making.

Tools Used:
	Microsoft Excel 2016
	Pivot Tables & Charts
	Data Validation & Lookup Formulas
	Conditional Formatting & Shape Styling

Process Overview:
 Data Collection & Import:
	Exported transaction data directly from bank statements in CSV format.
	Cleaned and standardized the dataset including columns such as Transaction Date, Description, Debit, Credit, Amount, and Payee Details.

 Data Structuring & Categorization:
	Created a Master Table for unique payees with assigned Subcategories and Categories (e.g., Groceries → Food & Dining → Expense).
	Used XLOOKUP/VLOOKUP to auto-fill subcategory, category, and payment type based on the transaction description.

 Payment Mode Identification:
	Parsed payment modes like UPI, Debit Card, NEFT, ATM, Interest Credit using SEARCH and IF formulas within descriptions for automated classification.

 Interactive Dashboard Design:
	Implemented Pivot Tables for summarizing key figures: Monthly Spend, Income, Savings, and Top Expense Categories.
	Used custom shapes, color themes (soft purples and gradients), and icons to build a modern, intuitive user interface.
	Linked text boxes and icons to pivot outputs for real-time updates and interactive visuals.

 Dynamic Data Model:

	Transformed raw data into structured Excel Tables (Ctrl+T) ensuring seamless pivot refresh and one-click updates for new data (e.g., monthly transactions).

 Key Features:
	Automated Categorization of all financial transactions
	Spend Year-To-Date summary with breakdown across major categories
	Visual tracking of discretionary vs. essential expenses
	Easy refresh mechanism for month-over-month updates

 Doughnut Chart: Total Spend by Account
	To enhance the visual breakdown of spending, a doughnut chart was added to the dashboard. 
	This visual showcases how spending is distributed across different bank accounts (or payment methods), offering a quick glance at fund utilization.

	Steps Followed:
	 Pivot Table Creation:
	 Inserted a new pivot table on the Analysis Sheet:
	 Payment Type as the row field.
	 Sum of Debit as the value field (formatted as currency, no decimals).
	 Named the pivot table: PTPayTypePie.
	 Doughnut Chart Insertion:
	 Inserted a Doughnut Chart via the "Insert Pie or Doughnut Chart" menu.
	 Customized:
	 Legend: Moved to the bottom.
	 Data Labels: Enabled percentages only (wrapped to a new line), removed leader lines.
	 Doughnut Hole Size: Reduced from 75% to 50% for a fuller visual.
	 Chart Title: Set as “Total Spend by Payment Type”.
	 Dashboard Placement & Styling:
	 Moved the chart to the Dashboard Sheet and resized it to fit within columns.
	 Applied a gradient fill background (vertical orientation, two color stops) for consistency with the overall dashboard design.
	 Enabled rounded corners to match the aesthetic style of other visuals.
	 Removed unnecessary chart outlines and gridlines for a clean look.
	 Center-Aligned Total Spend Display:
	 Inserted a text box in the center of the doughnut to display the total spend.
	 Linked the text box to the pivot table’s grand total using a reference workaround (typed the cell address instead of direct clicking).
	 Formatted the box with:
	 White font, center alignment, no fill, and no outline.

 Dual Column Chart: Monthly Expenses & Net Income
 To compare monthly expenses and net income side by side, two clustered column charts were created and visually combined into a dual chart.
	Steps Followed:
	Pivot Table 1 – Monthly Expenses:
	Inserted a pivot table filtered by month using the Date field (grouped by Month only)
	Values: Sum of Debit Amount (formatted as currency without decimals)
	Named: PTMntExpBar
	Chart 1 – Expenses Column Chart:
	Inserted a Clustered Column Chart
	Customizations:
	Removed field buttons, legend, and gridlines
	Added data labels
	Set vertical axis range: 0 to 230000
	Adjusted Gap Width to 50% for wider bars
	Removed shape fill/outline and moved the chart to the Dashboard

	Pivot Table 2 – Net Income:
	Duplicated the first pivot table, replacing the value with Amount (representing net income).
	Removed the Category Type field.
	Formatted the values with comma separator, no decimals.
	Named: PTMntNetIncBar
	Chart 2 – Net Income Column Chart:
	Inserted another Clustered Column Chart.
	Matched all visual settings with the Expenses chart:
	Changed axis range (-150000 - 0), same gap width, no gridlines.
	Applied a fill color and added a trendline in matching color.
	Removed fill and outline, then placed on the Dashboard below the expenses chart.
 
 Line Chart: Monthly Trend by Expense Category
 This line chart displays the monthly trend of various expense categories, helping users analyze spending behavior over time.
	Steps Followed:
	Pivot Table Setup:
	Duplicated a previous pivot table and adjusted fields:
	Named: PTCatExpLine
	Rows: Date (grouped by month)
	Filters: Category Type
	Columns: Category
	Values: Sum of Amount
	Removed grand totals and filtered to show only expense categories.
	Sorted categories in descending order based on only amounts spread across all months for better clarity.
	Chart Creation – Line Chart:
	Inserted a Line Chart based on the pivot table.
	Customizations:
	Removed field buttons.
	Placed legend at the top (serves as the chart title).
	Resized the chart to fit all category names in a single row.
	Design Enhancements:
	Cut and placed the chart on the Dashboard sheet
	Applied consistent formatting:
	Rounded corners for visual uniformity
	Matched color scheme with previous charts

 Tree Map Chart: Expense Distribution by Category
 The tree map visually represents proportional spending across categories, using area size to indicate the amount spent.
	Steps Followed:
	Pivot Table Workaround:
	Rows: Category -> Sub_category
	Values: Sum of Debit
	Filters: Category Type
	Since Excel doesn’t directly support creating a tree map from a pivot table:
	Copied the pivot data and used Paste Special (Values) to convert it into static data
	Inserted a Tree Map Chart from this pasted data
	Right-clicked the Tree Map -> Selected Data -> Edited references to point back to the original pivot table for:
	Category labels
	Debit values
	Formatting:
	Resized and placed the Tree Map on the Dashboard sheet.
	Removed chart outline.
	Since rounded corners are not available for Tree Maps, wrapped it in a rounded rectangle shape for design consistency.

 Waterfall Chart: Income to Net Balance Flow
 This chart shows how income is reduced by various expenses to arrive at the final balance.
	Steps:
	Pivot Table Setup:
	Created on the Analysis Sheet with:
	Date in Filters
	Category in Rows
	Sum of Amount in Values
	Named the pivot table PTWaterFall
	Manual Sorting:
	Rearranged rows manually to show Salary at the top, followed by expenses.
	Chart Creation:
	Copied & pasted pivot data as values (Tree Map workaround).
	Inserted a Waterfall Chart using this data.
	Relinked chart labels and values to original pivot table for dynamic updates.
	Marked the last column (Net) as a Total column.
	Formatting:
	Removed gridlines and vertical axis.
	Applied a modern chart style.
	Cut and pasted the chart into the dashboard.
	Used a shape with rounded corners behind the chart (since waterfall charts don’t support rounded corners directly).
	Left chart title blank to be dynamically filled later.

 Top 5 Categories Table with Conditional Formatting
 A summary table highlighting the five largest expense sub-categories.
	Steps:
	Created a Pivot Table:
	Filtered to show the Top 5 sub-categories by Sum of Debit.
	Removed Grand Total.
	Copied the pivot values into the Dashboard using Paste Links.
	Formatting:
	Applied currency formatting to the values.
	Added Conditional Formatting → Data Bars in purple for visual ranking.
	Used a shape (thick underline) for a stylish table title without overlapping charts.

 Slicers for Interactive Filtering
 Slicers allow dynamic filtering of the dashboard by Category and Month.
	Steps:
	Inserted Slicers from a pivot table tied to the Tree Map:
	Category and Date slicers
	Customized slicer style to match dashboard aesthetics
	Formatted slicers:
	Renamed headers (e.g., “Month”).
	Hide items with no data.
	Slicer Placement:
	Aligned both slicers on either side of the dashboard
	Adjusted width and button size to fit layout
	Slicer Connections:
	Connected slicers to multiple pivot tables using Report Connections:
	Tree Map
	Expense Column Chart
	Waterfall Chart
Outcome:
Built an interactive Excel dashboard to track personal finance, visualize income and expenses, analyze savings trends, 
and compare actual vs. budgeted spending using pivot tables, slicers, and dynamic charts.
